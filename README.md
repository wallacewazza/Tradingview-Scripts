23 year old International Business and Management Student.
University of central lancashire


1st stage.
These are scripts that I have composed learning to code on Tradingview.com throughout 2019. Most are created from curiosity; some are deviations of existing ideas like Pairs trading books and The William Vix Fix Formula.

Second Stage.
In 2020, I am currently studying python in my spare time. Secondly, after getting a decent grasp of the language to convert them into python scripts and use Quantconnent.com's automated algorithm for much more accurate backtest and live auto trials.

One of my favourites I will study is the PSAR, BB Bands strategy and Max Sharpe  Quantconnect's lean seems more complicated in contrast to Tradingview's pinescript. However, the advantages cant be compared.

I expect this project to take me 6-8 months to get a solid grasp of conversion, Algo and quant-coding.

In 2021 I hope I will be a great coder, hopefully, study sentiment-based Quants.More updates coming soon.

Best Wishes
