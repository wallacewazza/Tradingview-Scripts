1st stage.
These are scrits that I have written while I learned how to code on Tradingview.com throughout 2019. Most of them are made out of curiosity, some are deviations of existing ideas like Pairs trading and The William Vix Fix Formula.

Second Stage.
In 2020,I am currently learning python in my spare time. Secondly after getting a decent a grasp of the language convert them into python scripts and use Quantconnent.com's automated algorithm for much more accurate backtest and live auto trials.

One of my favorites I will look into is the PSAR BB Bands strategy. Quantconnect's lean appears more complex than pinescript


I expect this project take me 6-8 months to get a good grasp of it.

More Updates soon
